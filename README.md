# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
We all hate the question *"What do you want for dinner?"*, and we all hate the answer *"I don't know, what do you want?"* even more. The "What's For Dinner?" application helps solve that problem by allowing users to generate random recipe ideas based on the selection of categories of side dish, main dish, dessert, or entire meal. To begin constructing this application, I started with blank HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and added functionality based in part off of a screenshot of the application's desired design and in part off of a description of the application's desired functionality. 

### Installation Instructions:
To get started using the "What's for Dinner?" application, please fork this repository and clone it down to the desired location on your local machine. After navigating to the directory in your terminal, open it in a code reader like Visual Studio Code. Select the index.html file from the left-hand explorer menu and use terminal command `open index.html` to open the application in your browser. At this time, the "What's for Dinner?" application only works locally.

### Context:
This application was created over the course of five days, during my time as a student at the Turing School of Software and Design. When I built it, I was three weeks into the program. 

### Contributors:
The "What's for Dinner?" application was created solo by [Em Lindvall](https://github.com/emlindvall).

### Learning Goals:
Over the course of this project, my primary goal was to tie together my knowledge of JavsScript, HTML, and CSS into one cohesive, functioning application. My secondary goal was to establish better git workflow habits to better track changes throughout the coding process. 

### Wins + Challenges:
I'm very proud of the outcome for this project. I researched, learned about, and implemented a lot of features that were completely new to me-- flex box CSS, HTML radio buttons, and HTML span styling being the three that stand out most readily. My biggest hurdle with this project was understanding radio buttons, how to access their values, and how to clear them after selection. I used a combination of MDN and Stack Overflow to see examples of this funcationality in action and extrapolate in how to apply it to my own project.
